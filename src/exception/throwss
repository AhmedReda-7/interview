throws is a keyword in Java which is used in the signature of method to indicate that this method might throw one of the listed type exceptions. The caller to these methods has to handle the exception using a try-catch block.

Syntax:

type method_name(parameters) throws exception_list
exception_list is a comma separated list of all the
exceptions which a method might throw.
In a program, if there is a chance of raising an exception then compiler always warn us about it and compulsorily we should handle that checked exception, Otherwise we will get compile time error saying unreported exception XXX must be caught or declared to be thrown. To prevent this compile time error we can handle the exception in two ways:

By using try catch
By using throws keyword
We can use throws keyword to delegate the responsibility of exception handling to the caller (It may be a method or JVM) then caller method is responsible to handle that exception.

Important points to remember about throws keyword:

throws keyword is required only for checked exception and usage of throws keyword for unchecked exception is meaningless.
throws keyword is required only to convince compiler and usage of throws keyword does not prevent abnormal termination of program.
By the help of throws keyword we can provide information to the caller of the method about the exception.
